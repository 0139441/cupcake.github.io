# 2048 Cupcakes
2048 Cupcakes is a 2048-based game that uses almost exactly the same code, yet, uses cupcake images in place of the numbers.
I based this off of [Video Game Central](http://videogamecentral.net/test/)'s game, in fact, it uses the exact same images!
Anyway, I figured if I showed this to people, they might be able to easily make their own clones!

Here's a hint: go into [`/style/main.css`] get any type of image(s) you'd like, and find line `436`.
Notice how there's a background property? Enjoy!
