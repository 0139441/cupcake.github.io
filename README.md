# 2048 Cupcakes
2048 Cupcakes is a 2048-based game that uses almost exactly the same code, yet, uses cupcake images in place of the numbers.
I based this off of [Video Game Central](http://videogamecentral.net/test/)'s game, in fact, it uses the exact same images!
Anyway, I figured if I showed this to people, they might be able to easily make their own clones!
