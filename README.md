# 2048 Cupcakes
2048 Cupcakes is a 2048-based game that uses almost exactly the same code, yet, uses cupcake images in place of the numbers.
I used the code from [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/) and I took inspiration from [Video Game Central](http://videogamecentral.net/test/)'s game, in fact, it uses most of the same cupcake images.
Anyway, I figured that if I showed this to people, they might be able to easily make their own clones!

**Here's a hint (for making your own):** go to line [`436`](style/main.css#L436) in [`style/main.css`](style/main.css): notice how there's a `background` property within that style? Enjoy!
